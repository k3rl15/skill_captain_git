1. **Branching Strategies:**

   a. Created a new folder named Git Assignments. Navigated to the folder path in command prompt. Executed 'git init'.

   b. Created 2 branch using 'git checkout -b'. They are "feature-login" and "feature-logout"

   c. Switched to branch "feature-login" using 'git checkout -b feature-login'. Executed in terminal 'echo TODO > login.py' then 'git add login.py' . Switched to branch "feature-logout" using 'git checkout -b feature-logout'. Executed in terminal 'echo TODO > logout.py' then 'git add logout.py'.

   d. Whilst on branch "feature-login" commited the changes made with 'git commit -m "Implement login feature" and also did the same with branch "feature-logout" commited changes with 'git commit -m "Implement logout feature". Proceeded to push the branches to a remote repository by executing 'git remote add main https://github.com/k3rl15/skill_captain_git' to set up a link to the repository. Finally pushed the branches with 'git push main feature-login' and 'git push main feature-logout'.
