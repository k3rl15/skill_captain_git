1. **Branching Strategies:**

   a. Created a new folder named Git Assignments. Navigated to the folder path in command prompt. Executed 'git init'.
   b. Created 2 branch using 'git checkout -b'. They are "feature-login" and "feature-logout"
   c. Switched to branch "feature-login" using 'git checkout -b feature-login'. Executed in terminal 'echo TODO > login.py' then 'git add login.py' and finally commited it with 'git commit -m "Implement login feature". Switched to branch "feature-logout" using 'git checkout -b feature-logout'. Executed in terminal 'echo TODO > logout.py' then      'git add logout.py' and finally commited it with 'git commit -m "Implement logout feature".
   d. Commit your changes and push the branches to a remote repository.
